# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Bhawuk Arora

I'm a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, and Microsoft Azure, with hands-on experience in cloud-native applications and Salesforce Development. 

Driven by curiosity and innovation, I blend technical problem-solving with creative exploration. From flying RC aircraft and building drones to researching AI-driven cybersecurity systems and writing engaging contentâ€”I find inspiration at the intersection of tech and imagination.
