# 🌟 💫 Bonjour! 😊 Moi c'est Bhawuk! <🤠/>

Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts! I'm **Bhawuk Arora**, a B.Tech student in **AI & Data Science** at **Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur**. I spend my days talking to computers and convincing them to cooperate (mostly with **Java** ☕, **Spring Boot** 🥾, and **Microsoft Azure** ☁️). I'm basically a cloud wrangler 🌩️ and a bug whisperer 🐛🔧.

## 💡 About Me 😎

- **Entrepreneurial mindset**? ✅ That’s a fancy way of saying I have too many ideas 💡 and not enough time ⏰.
- Interests:
  - 🛩️ Building RC aircraft. (Yes, they fly... usually. ✈️🚀)
  - ✍️ Writing content. (Because I have to explain my spells to others in a way that doesn’t make their eyes glaze over. 📜🖋️)
  - 🤝 Open-source contributions. (Sharing is caring, even with code. 🤗💻)
- Obsessed with **cybersecurity** 🛡️🔐. Who doesn’t love a good firewall drama? 🔥🚪
- I’m on a mission to learn everything 📚, one YouTube tutorial 🎥 and crash course at a time. 🤓💥
