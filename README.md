# 🌟 💫 Bonjour! 😊 Moi c'est Bhawuk! <🤠/>

Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts! I'm **Bhawuk Arora**, a B.Tech student in **AI & Data Science** at **Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur**. Translation: I spend my days talking to computers and convincing them to cooperate (mostly with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Microsoft Azure**). I'm basically a cloud wrangler and a bug whisperer.

## 💡 About Me

- **Entrepreneurial mindset**? Check. That’s a fancy way of saying I have too many ideas and not enough time.
- Interests:
  - 🛩️ Building RC aircraft. (Yes, they fly... usually.)
  - ✍️ Writing content. (Because someone has to explain what I do in human language.)
  - 🤝 Open-source contributions. (Sharing is caring, even with code.)
- Obsessed with **cybersecurity**. Who doesn’t love a good firewall drama?
- I’m on a mission to learn everything, one YouTube tutorial and crash course at a time.
