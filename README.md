# 🌟 💫 Bonjour! 😊 Moi c'est Bhawuk! <🤠/>

Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts!  
I'm **Bhawuk Arora**, a **B.Tech student in AI & Data Science** at **Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur**.  

I spend my days talking to computers and convincing them to cooperate (mostly with **Java** ☕, **Spring Boot** 🥾, and **Microsoft Azure** ☁️).  
I'm basically a **cloud wrangler** 🌩️ and a **bug whisperer** 🐛🔧.

## 💡 **About Me** 😎  

- **Entrepreneurial Mindset** ✅  
  That’s a fancy way of saying I have too many ideas 💡 and not enough time ⏰.  

### **Interests**  
- 🛩️ **Building RC Aircraft and Drones**  (Yes, they fly... usually. ✈️🚀)  
- ✍️ **Writing Content**  (Because I have to explain my spells to others in a way that doesn’t make their eyes glaze over. 📜🖋️)  
- 🤝 **Open-Source Contributions**  (Sharing is caring, even with code. 🤗💻)  


### **Always Learning** 📚  
I’m on a mission to learn everything, one **YouTube tutorial** 🎥 and **crash course** 💥 at a time. 🤓  

---

### **In a Nutshell**  
If it involves **technology**, **creativity**, and a healthy dose of **caffeine-induced genius**, I’m your person. ✌️

## 🌟 Words to Live By ✨

> **"Innovation distinguishes between a leader 👑 and a follower 🐑."**
