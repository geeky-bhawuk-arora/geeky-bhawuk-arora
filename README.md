# 🌟 💫 Bonjour! 😊 Moi c'est Bhawuk! <🤠/>

Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts!  
I'm **Bhawuk Arora**, a **B.Tech student in AI & Data Science** at **Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur**.  

I spend my days talking to computers and convincing them to cooperate (mostly with **Java** ☕, **Spring Boot** 🥾, and **Microsoft Azure** ☁️).  
I'm basically a **cloud wrangler** 🌩️ and a **bug whisperer** 🐛🔧.

# 💡 **About Me** 😎  

An **entrepreneurial firecracker**? That’s me! ✅  
Translation: **too many ideas** 💡, **too little time** ⏰, but hey, I make it work.

### **Obsessions That Keep Me Up at Night**  
- 🛩️ **RC Aircraft and Drones**  
   I build ‘em, I fly ‘em, and occasionally, I *crash* ‘em. (It’s part of the process, okay? ✈️🚀)  
- ✍️ **Writing Spells—Uh, Content**  
   I can make even the most terrifying tech sound like a bedtime story. 📜🖋️  
- 🤝 **Open-Source Wizardry**  
   Sharing code, breaking barriers, and high-fiving strangers through GitHub. 🤗💻

### **The Lifelong Crash Course** 📚  
My brain’s permanently on a **YouTube playlist** 🎥, hopping from one crash course 💥 to the next.  
**Cybersecurity?** Yes, please! **Cloud?** Bring it on! **Quantum?** Why not?  

---

### **TL;DR Version**  
If it involves **tech**, **creativity**, and **caffeine-fueled brilliance**, I’m already there.  
Catch me juggling a keyboard and a coffee cup. (I’m great at both. ✌️☕)

## 🌟 Words to Live By ✨
