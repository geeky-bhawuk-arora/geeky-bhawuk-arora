# Hey there! I'm Bhawuk. ðŸ‘‹

On paper, I'm a student of AI & Data Science. In reality, I'm a professional bug creator and a full-time enthusiast of things that fly (and occasionally crash).

### So, What Do I Actually Do?

* I teach computers how to think, mostly so I can get them to do my homework. So far, they've only learned to ask for more RAM.
* Powered by an unhealthy amount of coffee and the sacred texts of Stack Overflow. My code is 90% logic, 10% magic, and 100% held together by hope.
* I put things in the cloud. It's like a digital attic where I can store my projects and forget about them, professionally.
* My main hobby is "rapid, unscheduled disassembly." I build things to fly, and they teach me valuable lessons about gravity.

### My Life Philosophy

> I believe in a decluttered mind. My 37 open browser tabs, however, respectfully disagree.

My goal is to write code that's as clean as my room... which means it's a work in progress.

### Wanna Chat?

Got a wild idea? A bug that's driving you crazy? Or do you just want to debate whether a hot dog is a sandwich?

**Hit me up! Let's create something cool (or at least have a good laugh).**
