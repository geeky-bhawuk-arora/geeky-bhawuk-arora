# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bhawuk Arora

Iâ€™m a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur, with a strong focus on **Java, Spring Boot**, and **Microsoft Azure**. I specialize in building **cloud-native applications** and have hands-on experience in **Salesforce development**.

Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and creativity, whether it's flying RC aircraft, building drones, or researching AI-powered cybersecurity solutions. I thrive at the intersection of **innovation and impact**, combining technical precision with imaginative thinking.

To me, learning is a continuous journey. I believe clarity doesnâ€™t come from thinking less, but from organizing thoughts with purpose. True creativity emerges from a **decluttered mind**, where systems align with values and action is rooted in intention.

## ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Connect

Have an idea to build, a bug to fix, or just want to chat over coffee?  
Letâ€™s **innovate**, **iterate**, and create something meaningful, together.
