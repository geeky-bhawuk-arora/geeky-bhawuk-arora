# 🌟 💫 Bonjour! 😊 Moi c'est Bhawuk! <🤠/>

Hello, fellow tech enthusiasts!  
I'm **Bhawuk Arora**, a B.Tech student in **AI & Data Science** at **Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur**.  

I spend my days talking to computers and convincing them to cooperate (mostly with **Java** ☕, **Spring Boot** 🥾, and **Microsoft Azure** ☁️).  
Think of me as a **cloud wrangler** 🌩️ and a **bug whisperer** 🐛🔧.

## 💡 **About Me** 😎

### 🌍 What Makes Me Tick:
- Entrepreneurial mindset? ✅  
  (That’s a fancy way of saying I have too many ideas 💡 and not enough time ⏰.)
- Obsessed with **cybersecurity** 🛡️🔐.  
  (Who doesn’t love a good firewall drama? 🔥🚪)

### 🎯 Interests:
- 🛩️ Building RC aircraft and drones.  
  (Yes, they fly... usually. ✈️🚀)
- ✍️ Writing content.  
  (Explaining my spells in ways that don’t make people’s eyes glaze over. 📜🖋️)
- 🤝 Open-source contributions.  
  (Sharing is caring, even with code. 🤗💻)

### 🚀 On a Mission:
To learn **everything** 📚, one **YouTube tutorial** 🎥 and **crash course** 💥 at a time.  

Basically, if it involves **technology**, **creativity**, and a healthy dose of **caffeine-induced genius**, I’m your person. ✌️

## 🌟 **Words to Live By** ✨
