# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Bhawuk Arora

I'm a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science at Poornima College of Engineering, Jaipur. I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, and Microsoft Azure, with hands-on experience in cloud-native applications and Salesforce Development. 

Driven by curiosity and innovation, I blend technical problem-solving with creative exploration. From flying RC aircraft and building drones to researching AI-driven cybersecurity systems and writing engaging content... I find inspiration at the intersection of tech and imagination.

I embrace learning as an infinite voyageâ€¦ one where remembrance holds equal weight to discovery. Clarity, I have found, is not born from the absence of thought but from the elegant organisation of what truly matters. The efficacy of any system, to me, rests in its alignment with my deepest values, transcending mere productivity to become an extension of self. Creativity flourishes in the fertile ground of a decluttered mind, where ideas flow with grace and intention. This is not just about getting things done; it is about nurturing clarity, fostering growth, and honouring the rhythm of my evolving journey.
